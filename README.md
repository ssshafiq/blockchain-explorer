	- pg host, port, database, username, password details.
```json
 "pg": {
		"host": "127.0.0.1",
		"port": "5432",
		"database": "fabricexplorer",
		"username": "hppoc",
		"passwd": "password"
	}
```

**Important repeat after every git pull
Run create database script.

- `cd blockchain-explorer/app/persistence/postgreSQL/db`
- `./createdb.sh`

Run db status commands.
Connect to PostgreSQL database.

#### Ubuntu

- `sudo -u postgres psql`

#### macOS

 - `psql postgres`

- `\l` view created fabricexplorer database
- `\d` view created tables

<a name="Fabric-Network-Setup"/>

## Fabric Network Setup

 Setup your own network using [Build your network](http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/build_network.html) tutorial from Fabric. Once you setup the network, please modify the values in `/blockchain-explorer/app/platform/fabric/config.json` accordingly.

<a name="Fabric-Configure-Hyperledger-Explorer"/>

## Fabric Configure Hyperledger Explorer

On another terminal.

- `cd blockchain-explorer/app/platform/fabric`
- Modify config.json to update network-config.
	- Change "fabric-path" to your fabric network path,
	example: "/home/user1/workspace/fabric-samples" for the following keys: "tls_cacerts", "key", "cert".
	- Final path for key "tls_cacerts" will be:  "/home/user1/workspace/fabric-samples/first-network/crypto-config/peerOrganizations/org1.example.com/peers/peer0.org1.example.com/tls/ca.crt".
- Modify "syncStartDate" to filter data by block timestamp
- Modify "channel" to your default channel

 **or**

## Hyperledger Composer Setup

 Setup your own network using Composer [Build your network](https://hyperledger.github.io/composer/latest/installing/development-tools) from Hyperledger Composer. Once you setup the network, please modify the values in `/blockchain-explorer/app/platform/fabric/config.json` accordingly.

<a name="Composer-Configure-Hyperledger-Explorer"/>

## Composer Configure Hyperledger Explorer

On another terminal.

- `cd blockchain-explorer/app/platform/fabric`
- Modify config.json to update network-config.
	- Change "fabric-path" to your composer network path,
	- Configure the Hyperledger composer based on this link [CONFIG-COMPOSER-HLEXPLORER.md](CONFIG-COMPOSER-HLEXPLORER.md)
- Modify "syncStartDate" to filter data by block timestamp
- Modify "channel" to your default channel

If you are connecting to a non TLS fabric peer, please modify the
protocol (`grpcs->grpc`) and port (`9051-> 9050`) in the peer url and remove the `tls_cacerts`. Depending on this key, the application decides whether to go TLS or non TLS route.

**or**

## Hyperledger Cello Setup

 Setup your fabric network using Cello [Build your network](https://cello.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setup/) from Hyperledger Cello. Once you setup the network, please modify the values in `/blockchain-explorer/app/platform/fabric/config.json` accordingly.

<a name="Cello-Configure-Hyperledger-Explorer"/>

## Cello Configure Hyperledger Explorer

On another terminal.

- `cd blockchain-explorer/app/platform/fabric`
- Modify config.json to update network-config.
	- Change "fabric-path" to your cello network path,
	- Configure the Hyperledger cello based on this link [CONFIG-CELLO-HLEXPLORER.md](CONFIG-CELLO-HLEXPLORER.md)
- Modify "syncStartDate" to filter data by block timestamp
- Modify "channel" to your default channel

If you are connecting to a non TLS fabric peer, please modify the
protocol (`grpcs->grpc`) and port (`9051-> 9050`) in the peer url and remove the `tls_cacerts`. Depending on this key, the application decides whether to go TLS or non TLS route.

## Build Hyperledger Explorer
**Important repeat after every git pull

On another terminal.

- `cd blockchain-explorer`
- `npm install`
- `cd blockchain-explorer/app/test`
- `npm install`
- `npm run test`
- `cd client/`
- `npm install`
- `npm test -- -u --coverage`
- `npm run build`

<a name="Run-Hyperledger-Explorer"/>

## Run Hyperledger Explorer

From new terminal.

- `cd blockchain-explorer/`
- `./start.sh`  (it will have the backend up).
- Launch the URL http://localhost:8080 on a browser.
- `./stop.sh`  (it will stop the node server).

- If the Hyperledger Explorer was used previously in your browser be sure to clear the cache before relaunching.

<a name="Hyperledger-Explorer-Swagger"/>

## Run Hyperledger Explorer using Docker

There is also an automated deployment of the **Hyperledger Explorer** available via **docker** having next assumptions:

* **BASH** installed
* **Docker** is installed on deployment machine.
### Non interactive deployment assumptions
* By default, deployment script uses **192.168.10.0/24** virtual network, and needs to be available with no overlapping IPs (this means you can't have physical computers on that network nor other docker containers running). In case of overlappings, edit the script and change target network and container targets IPs.
* By default both services (fronted and database) will run on same machine, but script modifications is allowed to run on separate machines just changing target DB IP on frontend container.
* Crypto material is correctly loaded under `examples/$network/crypto`
* Fabric network configuration is correctly set under `examples/$network/config.json`

### Steps to deploy using Docker

From new terminal.

- `cd blockchain-explorer/`
- Create a new folder (lets call it `dockerConfig`) to store your hyperledger network configuration under `examples` (`mkdir -p ./examples/dockerConfig`)
- Save your hyperledger network configuration under `examples/dockerConfig/config.json`.
- Save your hyperledger network certs data under `examples/dockerConfig/crypto`.
- Run the explorer pointing to previously created folder.

From new terminal.
- `cd blockchain-explorer/`
- `./deploy_explorer.sh dockerConfig`  (it will automatically deploy both database and frontend apps using Hyperledger Fabric network configuration stored under `examples/dockerConfig` folder)

Note: the example with additional information can be found at [examples/net1](./examples/net1) folder.

### Joining existing Docker network
If the Blockchain network is deployed in the Docker, you may pass network name as second parameter to join that network
(docker_network in the example below):
- `./deploy_explorer.sh dockerConfig docker_network`

### Steps to stop containers
- `./deploy_explorer.sh --down`

### Steps to remove containers and clean images
- `./deploy_explorer.sh --clean`
